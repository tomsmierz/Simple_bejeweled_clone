#How to run game:
- Game was writen in python 3.7, but shoud work with other 3.x versions. 
- It requires PyTorch and PyGame libraries
- To run game simply run script game.py 
(ex. in comand line C:\...\game_folder> python game.py)

TODO:
- fix animation bugs
- add more animations
- impement deep Q-learning with Experience Replay
- implement asynchronous actor-critic algoritm (A3C)
